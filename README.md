## Description:
  This project analyzes cybersecurity breach data to provide actionable insights into incident trends, impact assessment, and risk mitigation strategies. In today's interconnected world, organizations face constant cyber threats, making robust analysis crucial for effective security posture and proactive defense. This analysis offers a realistic view of cybersecurity challenges and potential solutions.
#  Project Overview:
## Business Problem:
Imagine a scenario where a company, like any modern enterprise, heavily relies on digital infrastructure. They store sensitive customer data, financial records, and intellectual property online. Over time, the company faces a growing number of cybersecurity incidents – breaches. These breaches result in the theft of sensitive data, disruption of services, and potential damage to the company's reputation. The IT security team struggles to keep up, lacking a clear understanding of the scale, scope, and impact of these breaches. This leads to delayed response times, ineffective security measures, and a general feeling of vulnerability. The company needs a system to track, analyze, and visualize these breaches to understand the threats better and take proactive steps to mitigate them.
##  Objective:
- To quantify the volume of cybersecurity breaches.
- To differentiate between open and closed breaches.
- To measure the average resolution time for breaches.
- To estimate the amount of data stolen due to breaches.
- To determine the number of employees affected and secured.
- To provide insights into employee ranking, department analysis, and branch analysis related to breaches.
##  Target Audience:

### Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):
 This analysis will provide the CISO with a high-level overview of the organization's security posture, enabling them to make strategic decisions about security investments and resource allocation.
### IT Security Managers: 
The detailed insights into breach trends and resolution times will help IT security managers to identify areas of vulnerability and improve their incident response processes.
### Department Heads: 
Understanding the department-specific analysis will enable department heads to enforce security protocols within their teams and promote a culture of security awareness.
### Human Resources: 
Insights into affected and secured employees can help HR in developing training programs and policies related to cybersecurity.
### Executive Management: 
The executive summary will provide a concise overview of the key findings and their potential impact on the business, facilitating informed decision-making at the highest level.
#  Data Structure and Data Model
![cyber security](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13b13f1f-0947-4dd8-8040-e10386558c37)

##  Data Sources:
### Cybersecurity Incident Database: 
This is the primary source containing records of all cybersecurity breaches, including details such as breach date, status (open/closed), data stolen, and affected employees.
### Employee Database: 
This source provides information on employees, including their department, branch, and security status.
## Data Cleaning:
- Handling missing values in fields such as "Estimate Stole Data (GB)" and "Breach End Days."
- Ensuring consistency in data formats for dates, employee IDs, and breach status.
- Removing duplicate records of breaches.
- Validating data entries for accuracy, such as ensuring "Secured Employees" is not greater than "Affected Employees."
##  Data Model:
### Fact Table: Cybersecurity Breaches

Breach ID (Primary Key)
Breach Date
Breach Status (e.g., Open, Closed)
Employee ID (Foreign Key)
Department ID (Foreign Key)
Branch ID (Foreign Key)

### Relationships:
The Cybersecurity Breaches fact table has a one-to-many relationship with each dimension table (Employee, Department, and Branch).
## d) Tools Used:
### Power BI:
This will be used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the cybersecurity breach data in a user-friendly and insightful manner. Power BI's capabilities for data modeling, DAX calculations, and report sharing make it ideal for this analysis.
### Excel: 
Excel can be used for initial data cleaning, data exploration, and potentially for some ad-hoc analysis. Its flexibility in data manipulation and formula-based calculations can be helpful in the preliminary stages of the project.
#  Executive Summary:
##  Key Findings:
In a landscape where digital assets are prime targets, our analysis reveals a concerning trend: cybersecurity breaches are not just a possibility; they are a persistent reality. We've uncovered that the organization is grappling with a significant number of security incidents. A total of 1,055 cybersecurity breaches were recorded, with a striking 910 remaining unresolved ("open"). This raises a critical question: Are current security protocols and response mechanisms effectively mitigating these threats? The data suggests a potential bottleneck, as only 145 breaches have been closed. The average time to resolve a breach stands at 243.63 days, a lengthy period that exposes the organization to prolonged risk. Furthermore, these breaches have resulted in the estimated theft of 138K gigabytes of data, a substantial loss that could have severe consequences. The impact extends to the workforce, with 16 million employees affected, while only 3 million are classified as "secured". This disparity begs the question: How effectively are security measures protecting the organization's most valuable asset – its people?
##  Impact:
- Increased risk of data loss and exposure of sensitive information.
- Potential financial losses due to recovery costs, fines, and reputational damage.
- Disruption of business operations and reduced productivity.
- Damage to the organization's reputation and loss of customer trust.
- Decreased employee morale and potential legal liabilities.
